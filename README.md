# Hi, this is us. :wave:

We are ReShop, a very little collective of people trying to make a custom eShop server for the Nintendo 3DS before the death of the eShop(March 2023).

Hope you'll enjoy our work!!!

## Important notice /!\
### For users who wants to run their eShop using our code
Of course, since this is open source software, you absolutely can.

But we've giving you some tips to not get f*cked up by Nintendo, or not to break stuff.
- DO NOT store official games on your eShop. <i>please.</i> you have 100% of chances to get destroyed by Nintendo, and don't blame this to us.
- We do not recommend to modify the codebase of IAS & ECS except to setup the database. This is really fragile stuff (by experience), and if you do ONE wrong thing, you could break the entire login process. (good luck for finding your error)
